# SimpleCompiler
This program acts as a compiler. Compiler reads a program, parses it, and ensures that its syntax and semantics are correct. If the program is incorrect, the compiler outputs an error message. If it is correct, the compiler outputs the sequence of values that the expressions in the program generate.
